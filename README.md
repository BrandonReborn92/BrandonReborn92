# Hello, I'm Brandon! 👋

I'm a passionate tech enthusiast with a diverse skill set in web development and programming. I thrive on challenges and love exploring the depths of coding and computer systems and the "Wow" factor of computers! Computers these days just do not seem to be as exciting as they used to, so I like to have my work call out to the classic times back when using a computer was EXCITING

## Skills 💻
- **Proficient:** 
  - HTML

- **Familiar with:** 
  - Java

  - VBS
  - CMD
- **Typing Speed:** 47 AWPM

## My Journey 🌱
My fascination with computers started at a young age, but it took off in 2009 when I began using Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing Version 15 and reading *Beginning Programming for Dummies*. This ignited my passion for coding, leading me to experiment with:
- Viruses
- Reverse engineering
- Scripting
- Social engineering
What one day was just a simple joke of making fake viruses, and exploiting my own system, going through computers like candy, eventually led me to new ideas, experimentation, and so much more!

These experiences paved the way for my career in computer forensics, computer repair, and Linux.

## Interests 🍳🎶
When I’m not coding, I enjoy:
- Cooking up delicious meals
- Creating music
- Continuously learning and experimenting with new technologies
